I wanted to practice with Image Array based on example_15_04_ImageArray2 to make a slide shows of my images and tell a short story. 

However, there are some difficulties that I countered: 

- I had to import manually each photos (there are 20 photos) in the "data" file.

- I still cannot make it work and display the slideshow as I wanted although I think I follow all the steps (I even copy the code from Dann and replace the images) from the example. Plus, processing did not declare any error. 


### Conclusion: First fail project in the class :(((((((
