#First Assignment: selfportrait with Processing 

The heart shape was just me following some tutorials online although I still cannot fully understand the code :((

Also, I don't want to draw a face with just an ellipse or a circle so I mix the two shape together. I want to delete half of the ellipse that is pointing up (as you can see in the photo) but I still couldn't find the solution. 

For me, this is a good exercise to get to know to coding and calculating the canvas position for each shape :)) 

The processing file is also uploaded on this folder.
